## Overview

Although R-R has existing systems to manage and view absence, they fail to meet some basic needs.
1. Allow any R-R computer user to view any colleagues absence information (with appropriate protection of people's data and compliance to any legistation on privacy)
2. Include 3rd party colleagues/contractors as well as regular staff
3. globally accessible

This project aims to overcome these deficiencies


## Usage

This project is just starting, will be a django web app with Javascript/jQuery on the front end, and Bulma.io CSS

## Contributing

To contribute changes to the original respository, the following commands can be used:

1. git remote add upstream ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY_URL

This will set your upstream to the repository you forked from.

2. git fetch upstream 

This will fetch all the branches including master from the original repository.

3. git merge upstream/master 

Pushes the changes to your forked repository i.e. to origin

4. git push origin master 

Voila! You are done with the syncing the original repository.
